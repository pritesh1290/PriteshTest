Ans-3 The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.
This approach enables the declarative API of React: We tell React what state We want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.

 When anything new is added to the application, a virtual DOM is created and it is represented as a tree. Each element in the application is a node in this tree. So, whenever there is a change in the state of any element, a new Virtual DOM tree is created. This new Virtual DOM tree is then compared with the previous Virtual DOM tree and make a note of the changes. After this, it finds the best possible ways to make these changes to the real DOM. Now only the updated elements will get rendered on the page again.

Ans-4 MySQL- Relational database in nature.
- Modeled based on the concept of "table".
- Being relational in nature,can be tough task to scale big data.
- Detailed database model needs to be in place before creation.
- vast and expert community is available.
- Standard language.
- Schema is rigid.
- Not so flexible design-wise,new column or field insertion affects design.

NoSQL-Non-Relational database in nature.
- Modeled based on the concept of "document".
-Easily scalable big data as compared to relational.
- No need to develop a detailed database model.
- Community is growing rapidly ans as smaller as  compared to MySQL.
- Lack of a standard query language.
- Dynamic Schmema.
- New columns or fields can be inserted without existing design.

Ans-1

Internet websites operate based on the collaboration between front-end and back-end components, each with its own responsibilities.

Front-end: The front-end, also known as the client-side, is responsible for the user-facing aspects of the website.

User Interface Design: It focuses on creating an appealing and intuitive interface that enhances user experience.

HTML/CSS Markup: HTML structures the content, while CSS defines the visual styles and layouts of the web pages.

Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript enables dynamic and interactive elements, allowing for form validation, animations, and real-time updates.

Back-end: The back-end, or server-side, manages the behind-the-scenes operations that support the website's functionality.

Server Handling: It receives and processes client requests, communicating with the front-end and performing necessary computations or operations.

Business Logic: The back-end implements the logic and algorithms required to deliver specific functionalities, such as processing payments, managing user accounts, or generating personalized content.

Database Management: It interacts with the database to store, retrieve, and modify data as needed, ensuring data consistency and security.

Ans-5. RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL, and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.

It is called Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) because it is based on the relational model introduced by E.F. Codd.
Data is represented in terms of tuples (rows) in RDBMS.

A relational database is the most commonly used database. It contains several tables, and each table has its primary key.

Due to a collection of an organized set of tables, data can be accessed easily in RDBMS.
